# Median_Cut_Algorithm
Semester project of group 742 on 7th semester VGIS

Important scrips: 
- FinalMedianCut: Performs median cut
- kmeans: Performs k-means
- newserver: Starts the python server
- DeepLeaningPython: Performs deep learning

How to star the server:
1) Open up the Median_Cut_Algorithm/Python/ folder as a project in your preffered Python IDE.
2) Install the various libraries used for the project, such as zmq, numpy, opencv2, keras..
3) Run newserver.py. It should print "server listening" if everything went okay. 

How to get light sources in Unity:
1) Open the Unity scene called "Demo FP controller bare" in  "Median_Cut_Algorithm/Unity/Group 742 Visualization/Assets/First person controller/Demo & documentation/".
2) Start the server.
3) Press play in Unity.
4) Press space to select options for light sources and press go when satisfied.
5) Wait for the light sources to appear before pressing escape or the x button in the top right to close the menu.
Controls: mouse to move camera, wasd or arrows to move around, space to open light menu, escape to close light menu, left shift to take screenshot (saved in screenshots folder after refresh).

Notes: lights with Deep learning does not work. The car may not appear in the scene. If this is the case, you can place another object to see the lights effect.
